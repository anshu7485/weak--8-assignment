RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique used in modern NLP systems to improve the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. 
Instead of relying only on a language model's internal memory, RAG retrieves relevant information from external documents or a database and then uses that context to generate answers.

Main Steps in RAG:
1. Retrieval: Identify relevant documents or text chunks using similarity search (like FAISS, BM25, etc.)
2. Augmentation: Combine the retrieved documents with the original user query to build a context.
3. Generation: Pass the context and query to a language model (LLM) to generate a final answer.

Applications of RAG:
- Chatbots with document knowledge
- Customer support automation
- Legal and medical Q&A systems
- Personalized education tutors

Popular libraries and tools used in RAG include:
- LangChain
- HuggingFace Transformers
- FAISS / ChromaDB / Weaviate
- OpenAI or open LLMs (Mistral, LLaMA, etc.)

RAG is especially useful when the data is too large to fit into a model's context window, or when working with dynamic and frequently updated information.
